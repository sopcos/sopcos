# 🚀 SOPCOS Release Strategy v1.0  
## “Anchor Release” — Governance Before Adoption

**Release Codename:** Anchor  
**Protocol Version:** SOPCOS v1.0  
**Release Type:** Foundational / Governance-First  
**Status:** Initial Public Release

---

## 1. Purpose of This Release

SOPCOS v1.0 is **not** a feature-complete platform release.  
It is a **constitutional release**.

The objective of v1.0 is to:
- Establish **canonical law**
- Fix **responsibility boundaries**
- Define **what SOPCOS will never become**

This release prioritizes **legal determinism over developer velocity**.

> If the law is unclear, adoption is dangerous.

---

## 2. Release Philosophy

### 2.1 Governance-First Principle

Most protocols ship code first and governance later.  
SOPCOS deliberately inverts this order.

**v1.0 ships:**
- Who decides
- How conflicts are resolved
- Who is liable
- What evidence is immutable

**v1.0 does NOT ship:**
- Growth incentives
- Permissionless chaos
- Autonomous authority

---

### 2.2 “Anchor” Meaning

This release acts as:
- A **legal anchor** for future versions
- A **forensic anchor** for audits
- A **semantic anchor** for implementers

Future releases may extend SOPCOS,  
but **cannot rewrite its foundations**.

---

## 3. Scope of v1.0 (What Is Included)

### 3.1 Ratified & Living Standards (Binding Law)

The following SIPs are **LIVING STANDARDS** and constitute enforceable protocol law:

#### Core Governance, Decision & Liability
- SIP-001 — Sopcos Policy Language (SPL)
- SIP-002 — Governance, Roles & Licensing
- SIP-003 — Decision Semantics & Canonical State
- SIP-004 — Threat Model & Accountability
- SIP-005 — Simulation & Proof of Foreknowledge
- SIP-006 — Human Override & Liability Transfer
- SIP-008 — Authority Hierarchy & Lifecycle Governance
- SIP-009 — Cryptographic Policy Envelope (.sop)
- SIP-010 — Verdict Algebra
- SIP-011 — Forensic Liability Semantics
- SIP-013 — Declared Reality Interface (Telemetry Binding)

These define the **minimum viable rule-of-law system**.

---

### 3.2 Non-Normative but Canonical Guidance

- SIP-Appendix-A — Canonical Incident Walkthrough  
- Glossary — Terminology Reference

These documents **do not define law**,  
but explain how the law behaves in reality.

---

## 4. Deferred but Declared (Intentionally Not Final)

The following SIPs are **explicitly included in scope** but are **NOT binding** in v1.0:

| SIP | Topic | Status | Reason |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| SIP-012 | Sovereign Mandate | PROPOSED | Requires operational field testing |
| SIP-014 | Artifact Vault | DRAFT | Infrastructure hardening pending |
| SIP-015 | Cognitive Verdicts | PROPOSED | AI governance must trail law |
| SIP-016 | Industrial Assets | DRAFT | Asset OpCodes still stabilizing |
| SIP-017 | Secure M2M Messaging | PROPOSED | Cryptographic review & audits pending |

> Declaring incompleteness is a security feature.

## 5. What SOPCOS v1.0 Explicitly Is Not

This release **rejects** the following interpretations:

-  Not a DAO
-  Not a smart contract platform
-  Not an autonomous AI governance system
-  Not a permissionless execution layer
-  Not “code is law”

**SOPCOS v1.0 asserts:**
> Law is data.  
> Execution is external.  
> Liability is human.

---

## 6. Target Audiences & Messaging

### 6.1 Primary: Industrial & Legal Stakeholders
**Message:**  
> “This system tells you who is responsible — with cryptographic proof.”

Focus:
- Regulators
- Insurers
- Safety officers
- Compliance & audit teams

---

### 6.2 Secondary: Protocol & Systems Engineers
**Message:**  
> “This is not a playground. This is an operating constitution.”

Focus:
- Determinism
- Fail-closed semantics
- Bounded execution
- Auditability

---

### 6.3 Tertiary: AI & Automation Architects
**Message:**  
> “AI may advise. Humans remain liable.”

Focus:
- SIP-005 + SIP-015 framing
- No hallucination tolerance
- Replayable cognition

---

## 7. Release Channels

### 7.1 Soft Release (Canonical First)
- GitHub (README + SIPs)
- Internal review
- Legal / compliance circulation

### 7.2 Public Disclosure
- Technical blog / whitepaper-style article
- Select conference talks (safety / industrial automation)
- No hype-driven marketing

**No token launch.  
No growth campaign.  
No ecosystem incentives.**

---

## 8. Upgrade Path & Forward Compatibility

- v1.0 establishes **irreversible constraints**
- Future versions may:
  - Add SIPs
  - Upgrade DRAFT → PROPOSED → LIVING
- Future versions may NOT:
  - Remove human liability
  - Grant autonomous authority
  - Break fail-closed guarantees

---

## 9. Final Statement

> SOPCOS v1.0 does not try to automate trust.  
> It makes trust **provable**, **auditable**, and **inescapable**.

This release is intentionally conservative.

Because in industrial reality,  
**moving fast and breaking things is not innovation — it is negligence.**
