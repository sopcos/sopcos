# 📦 SOPCOS Release Notes - v1.0  
## “Anchor Release”

**Release Codename:** Anchor  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Release Type:** Foundational / Governance-First  
**Status:** Initial Public Release  
**Date:** 2026-01

---

## Overview

SOPCOS v1.0 is the **first canonical public release** of the SOPCOS Protocol.

This release does **not** aim to maximize features, throughput, or adoption.  
It aims to establish **law, liability, and limits**.

> v1.0 answers *who is responsible* before asking *what is possible*.

---

## What’s New in v1.0

### ✅ Canonical Governance & Law (Binding)

SOPCOS v1.0 introduces a complete, enforceable **rule-of-law framework** for industrial decision systems.

**Ratified as LIVING STANDARDS:**
- Deterministic Policy Language (SPL)
- Authority Hierarchy & Verdict Algebra
- Human Override with Explicit Liability
- Simulation & Proof of Foreknowledge
- Cryptographic Evidence & Forensic Replayability
- Declared Reality & Telemetry Binding

These elements collectively define:
- How decisions are made
- How conflicts are resolved
- How responsibility is proven
- How evidence survives time

---

### 🧠 Human-in-the-Loop by Design

- SOPCOS explicitly **rejects autonomous liability**
- Machines may evaluate and recommend
- Humans remain **legally and cryptographically accountable**

Overrides are no longer “bypasses” -  
they are **signed confessions of responsibility**.

---

### 🔒 Fail-Closed, Deterministic Runtime

- No scripting
- No Turing-complete contracts
- No “last write wins”
- No silent defaults

If the law is unclear, the system **DENIES**.

---

## What Is Intentionally Absent

SOPCOS v1.0 **does not include**:

- ❌ Tokenomics or incentives
- ❌ DAO governance
- ❌ Autonomous AI authority
- ❌ Permissionless execution environments
- ❌ Smart contract platforms
- ❌ Growth or ecosystem programs

These omissions are **deliberate**, not missing features.

> In safety-critical systems, *absence is often a safeguard*.

---

## Deferred but Declared Capabilities

The following areas are acknowledged but **not binding** in v1.0:

- Sovereign Mandates (delegated agency)
- Cognitive Verdicts (AI recommendations)
- Secure M2M Messaging
- Industrial Digital Assets (NFT-based twins)
- Decentralized Artifact Vault infrastructure

They remain **Draft** or **Proposed** to ensure:
- Legal review precedes automation
- Governance precedes capability
- Reality precedes abstraction

---

## Backward Compatibility & Stability

- v1.0 establishes **irreversible constraints**
- Future versions may extend the protocol
- Future versions may **not**:
  - Remove human liability
  - Grant autonomous authority
  - Break fail-closed semantics
  - Rewrite historical accountability

---

## Intended Audience

This release is primarily for:
- Regulators & auditors
- Safety & compliance teams
- Industrial system architects
- Legal & risk professionals

It is **not** optimized for:
- Hackathon speed
- Rapid prototyping
- Experimental governance

---

## Known Limitations

- Infrastructure components (Vault, Asset Ops) are still maturing
- AI-related SIPs are intentionally conservative
- No reference implementation is mandated yet

These limitations are **documented, not hidden**.

---

## Final Note

> SOPCOS v1.0 does not promise efficiency.  
> It guarantees accountability.

This release establishes the **anchor point** from which all future SOPCOS evolution must proceed.

Breaking this foundation would not be an upgrade -  
it would be a breach of trust.

---

**Autonomy demands accountability.  
SOPCOS makes accountability enforceable.**
