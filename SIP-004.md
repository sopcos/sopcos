## 1. Abstract
This document defines the **Sopcos Threat Model**, explicitly acknowledging that cryptographic validity does not equate to truthfulness. It establishes the **"Accountability Framework"** to adjudicate disputes in scenarios involving malicious actors, broken hardware, or flawed policies.

## 2. The Core Axiom: "Evil but Compliant"

> **"A Synapse node may be malicious yet protocol-compliant."**

This axiom asserts that a Gateway can technically follow all protocol rules (valid signature, valid hash, valid format) while simultaneously lying about the physical reality. Sopcos cannot prevent lies; it ensures that **lies are recorded, signed, and legally actionable.**

## 3. Threat Scenarios (Caselaw)

### Scenario A: The "Lying Gateway" (Malicious Gateway, Honest Protocol)
**Context:** The factory temperature is 200°C (Fire). The Gateway Operator, wanting to avoid a shutdown, manually forces the Gateway to generate a decision saying "Temperature: 50°C -> ALLOW".
* **The Crime:** Falsifying the Input (The Oracle Problem).
* **Blame:** The **Gateway Operator** or **Node Owner**.
* **Proof:**
    1.  **Physical Evidence:** Burnt machine (Reality).
    2.  **Digital Evidence:** Signed decision on Axon saying "50°C".
    3.  **Conflict:** The signed lie proves the Gateway was either compromised or manipulated.
* **Punishment:**
    * **Protocol Level:** Certificate Revocation (Immediate ban from network).
    * **Legal Level:** The signed decision is admissible evidence of fraud or negligence against the Operator.

### Scenario B: The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (Honest Gateway, Broken Sensor)
**Context:** A sensor malfunctions and sends `0.0` value continuously. The Synapse Gateway receives `0.0`, checks the rule `IF < 100 ALLOW`, and permits operation. The machine freezes/breaks.
* **The Issue:** Faithful execution of bad data.
* **Blame:** The **Sensor Manufacturer** or **Maintenance Team**.
* **Proof:**
    * The `input_hash` on Axon matches the raw log of the `0.0` signal.
    * Synapse correctly applied the logic to the value it received.
    * **Verdict:** Synapse is innocent. It acted as a faithful mirror of the sensor.
* **Punishment:** None for the Protocol. Maintenance tickets issued for hardware repair.

### Scenario C: The "Lawful Evil" (Honest Execution, Bad Policy)
**Context:** An Admin accidentally writes a rule: `IF Temp > 1000 THEN ALLOW` (Typo: meant 100). The machine reaches 500°C and explodes. Synapse allowed it because 500 is not greater than 1000.
* **The Issue:** Correct execution of a disastrous instruction.
* **Blame:** The **Policy Author (Admin)** who signed the SPL contract.
* **Proof:**
    * The `policy_hash` on Axon points to the specific version containing the typo.
    * The signature on that Policy Version belongs to the Admin.
    * **Verdict:** Synapse is innocent. It is a deterministic machine, not a safety consultant.
* **Punishment:**
    * **Protocol Level:** None (The protocol worked perfectly).
    * **Legal Level:** Administrative negligence lawsuit against the Policy Author.

## 4. Conclusion: The Scope of Sopcos

Sopcos guarantees **Integrity** (The record hasn't changed) and **Authenticity** (Who signed it), but it does not guarantee **Truth** (Is the input real?) or **Wisdom** (Is the rule smart?).

By strictly defining these boundaries, Sopcos shifts the burden of "Truth" to the edge (Sensor/Operator) and the burden of "Wisdom" to the core (Admin), remaining a neutral, immutable witness to history.
