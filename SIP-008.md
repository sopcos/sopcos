## 1. Abstract
This specification establishes a rigid **Normative Authority Graph** and a **Jurisdiction Lattice** to resolve conflicts between competing policies. It replaces arbitrary priority integers with a constitutionally defined hierarchy and introduces **Pre-Law Constraints** based on immutable physical reality.

## 2. Core Axioms
1.  **Source of Power:** Power is derived from **Authority Definition (DID)** anchored on the L1 Registry, not from the policy payload or computational precedence.
2.  **The Pre-Law Reality:** Policy Code is Executable Law, but Physics is Immutable Reality.
3.  **Silence of the Machine:** If two equal laws contradict, the machine MUST remain silent (or fail-safe).

## 3. Policy Identity & Verification (The Registry)
Authority is not a self-proclaimed integer within the policy file; it is a **verified status derived from the L1 Chain**.

* **Identity Standard:** Policies are signed and identified by DIDs (e.g., `did:sopcos:policy:global:safety`).
* **Verification Logic:** The Runtime (Synapse) MUST verify the `authority_level` by querying the **L1 Registry** using the signer's DID.
* **Spoofing Protection:** If a policy claims `Level 0` in its metadata but the Registry reports `Level 5` (or no record) for that signer, the policy is executed at the **Registry's level** (or rejected).

## 4. The Normative Authority Graph

Sopcos operates on two planes of reality: Ontological (Immutable) and Normative (Mutable).

| Level | Name | Description | Override Semantics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **∞** | **PRE-LAW** | **Physical Constraints / Bio-Safety.** Hard-coded firmware limits. The "God Layer". | **IMPOSSIBLE** (Even for Humans) |
| **LVL 0** | **EMERGENCY** | Fire, Earthquake, Evacuation. | Only by Pre-Law |
| **LVL 1** | **REGULATORY** | Legal limits, Environmental laws. | By Emergency |
| **LVL 2** | **SITE / ORG** | Corporate or Factory-wide policies. | By Regulatory/Emergency |
| **LVL 3** | **OPTIMIZATION** | Efficiency, Cost-saving algorithms. | Always overridable |
| **LVL 4** | **ADVISORY** | Recommendations, Logging. | Lowest priority |

## 5. Jurisdiction Lattice & Scope Logic

Scope is not a tag; it is a **Normative Jurisdiction**.

### 5.1. Scope Containment
A verdict is valid **IFF** the target exists within the `policy.scope`.

### 5.2. Asymmetric Control (No Force-Allow)
A Global Authority can **SHUTDOWN** (restrict) a Local Operation, but it CANNOT **FORCE-ALLOW** (permit) an operation against a Local Safety Constraint.
* *Principle:* Global can restrict Local, but Global cannot violate Local Physics.

## 6. Conflict Resolution: The Deny-Absorbtion Axiom

In the verdict aggregation process, the `DENY` decision acts as the **Absorbing Element** (Zero Element) in algebra.

**Formula:**
$$Verdict_{Final} = V_1 \times V_2 \times ... \times V_n$$

**Truth Table:**
| Local Decision | Global Decision | **FINAL RESULT** | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ALLOW` | `ALLOW` | **ALLOW** | Consensus |
| `DENY` | `ALLOW` | **DENY** | Local Safety Constraint |
| `ALLOW` | `DENY` | **DENY** | Global Shutdown Order |
| `DENY` | `DENY` | **DENY** | Total Lock |

## 7. Human Override: Liability Substitution

A Human Override is **not** a "Super-Policy". It is the suspension of the Normative Graph, replaced by Personal Liability.

> **Constitutional Clause:** *"A Human Override does not create a higher authority. It suspends the authority graph for a bounded scope and time, replacing it with a Sole Liability Record anchored to the signer's DID."*

## 8. Authority Escalation Cost Matrix

To prevent abuse ("Fake Emergencies" or "Casual Regulation Bending"), activating high-authority levels incurs a cryptographic and bureaucratic cost.

| Level | Requirement | Time Lock | Max TTL (Sunset) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-Law (∞)** | **Immutable** | N/A | **Permanent** |
| **Emergency (L0)** | Single Sig (Authorized Operator) | 0s (Immediate) | **15 Minutes** (Strict Limit) |
| **Regulatory (L1)** | Multi-Sig (3+ diverse roles) | **24 Hours** | 1 Year |
| **Site/Org (L2)** | Multi-Sig (2 roles) | 1 Hour | 30 Days |
| **Optimization (L3)**| Single Sig (Engineer/Algo) | 0s | Unlimited |
