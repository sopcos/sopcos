# SOPCOS Assurance Framework (SAF) v1.1
## Industrial Liability Attribution Model

> **Reference ID:** SAF-2026-v1.1  
> **Version:** 1.1.0  
> **Status:** Interpretive Framework / Non-Normative  
> **Scope:** Legal, insurance, and forensic interpretation of SOPCOS evidence  
> **Audience:** Insurers, auditors, regulators, courts  
> **Normative Sources:** SOPCOS Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

Existing SCADA and industrial logging systems can demonstrate **what** physically occurred during an incident (e.g., *“the valve opened”*), but they typically cannot prove **why** it occurred or **under whose authority** with legal certainty.

The **SOPCOS Assurance Framework (SAF)** translates cryptographic, machine-verifiable evidence produced by SOPCOS into **legally interpretable concepts** for insurance, regulatory, and judicial processes.

The purpose of SAF is to convert operational ambiguity into **legally enforceable determinism**.

SAF does not define protocol behavior. It provides an **interpretive lens** for evidence already defined by SOPCOS SIPs.

## 2. SOPCOS Immutable Assurances (“The Immutable Truth”)

When correctly implemented, SOPCOS provides the following mathematically verifiable assurances that may be relied upon during claims assessment and legal review:

### 2.1 Non-Repudiation
Biometrically signed human interventions (VINCI) are cryptographically bound to a Decentralized Identifier (DID), making denial of authorship materially infeasible.

### 2.2 Proof of Notification
It can be demonstrated that:
- a risk warning was generated by the system, and - the warning was presented to, acknowledged by,  or explicitly bypassed by a human actor.

### 2.3 Explicit Responsibility Transfer
The moment control transitions from machine to human (e.g., Emergency Override) is recorded as a time-stamped, signed event, providing explicit evidence of authority transfer.

### 2.4 Asset Provenance
The identity of hardware components and associated AI models involved in an incident can be verified via **IDAS** (SIP-016), materially reducing uncertainty related to counterfeit parts, unauthorized software, or unapproved model deployment.

## 3. Incident Evidence Package (IEP) - v1.1

Forensic analysis and claims assessment may rely on a structured **Incident Evidence Package (IEP)**, sometimes described as an *“Industrial Black Box”* recorded on the Core Ledger.

### 3.1 IEP Components

| Component | Technical Origin | Legal / Insurance Relevance |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Decision Logs | Synapse `ALLOW` / `DENY` verdicts | Demonstrates whether the system operated within defined safety constraints |
| Foreknowledge Record | SIP-005 / SIP-015 prediction snapshot | Freezes the risk information available to the human at decision time |
| Override Certificate | SIP-006 / SIP-011 signed token | Evidence of explicit responsibility transfer |
| IDAS Certificate | SIP-016 Industrial Digital Asset | Proves identity, provenance, and service history of involved assets |
| WORM Vault Proof | SIP-014 Vault Integrity | Demonstrates physical and logical immutability of evidence |

## 4. Claims Interpretation Matrix (Indicative)

The following mappings illustrate **typical interpretive patterns** for insurers and legal reviewers. They are **illustrative**, not prescriptive.

### 4.1 System Compliance

- **Synapse Verdict:** `DENY`  
- **Indicative Interpretation:**  
  The system enforced safety constraints as designed. Evidence may support a finding of **system compliance**.

### 4.2 Responsibility Transfer

- **Vinci Event:** `OVERRIDE`  
- **Indicative Interpretation:**  
  Authority was transferred from automated enforcement (Synapse) to a human actor.
  Evidence may support classification as   **human intervention** or **operational negligence**, depending on context.

### 4.3 Foreknowledge with Bypass

- **Prediction Level:** `CRITICAL`
- **Subsequent Action:** Override or bypass  
- **Indicative Interpretation:**  
  Evidence may support a finding of  **gross negligence** or **willful misconduct**, subject to jurisdictional standards.

### 4.4 Silent Notification

- **Event:** Encrypted Silent Alarm (SIP-017)  
- **Indicative Interpretation:**  
  Demonstrates fulfillment of a **duty to notify** while preserving trade secrets and sensitive vulnerabilities.

---

## 5. AI and Cognitive Oversight (SIP-015)
Within SOPCOS, Artificial Intelligence is treated as a **cognitive auditor (Axon)**, not an authority.

### 5.1 Deterministic Replay
When an AI-generated recommendation is questioned, the decision context can be reconstructed using:
- the identical model version,
- the identical sealed data,
allowing **forensic replay**.

### 5.2 Liability Shield Principle
Even if an AI recommendation is flawed, responsibility remains with the human actor holding the relevant **Sovereign Mandate** (SIP-012).

Machines do not bear legal guilt.
Authority does.

## 6. Value Proposition for Insurers

SAF enables insurers to:

- **Reduce Disputes:**  
  Mathematical evidence shortens investigation and litigation cycles.
- **Mitigate Moral Hazard:**  
  Persistent identity binding discourages reckless overrides.
- **Enable Usage-Based Industrial Insurance (UBII):**  
  Premiums may be dynamically adjusted based on
  measurable **Dirty State duration** and override frequency.

---

## 7. Legal Positioning

SAF:
- Does **not** replace statutory law
- Does **not** mandate claim outcomes
- Does **not** constitute legal advice

It provides a **structured evidentiary framework** to support interpretation by qualified professionals under applicable law.

## Final Statement

> SOPCOS does not decide who is guilty.  
> It ensures that **responsibility can be proven**.

The SOPCOS Assurance Framework exists to ensure that automation does not erase accountability, but instead renders it **auditable, attributable, and enforceable**.
