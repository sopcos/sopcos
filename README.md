# 🦅 SOPCOS — The Industrial Trust Protocol

### System of Phronetic Control & Open Safety

**“Autonomy demands accountability. We are not just shipping fast; we are shipping responsibly.”**

---

## 🏗️ Abstract

**SOPCOS** is a deterministic industrial protocol designed to close the **Liability Gap** in autonomous and semi-autonomous systems (Industry 4.0 / 5.0).

While existing systems optimize machines for speed and efficiency, SOPCOS addresses the missing layer:

**legal ownership of machine decisions.**

SOPCOS transforms automated actions into **verifiable, attributable, and non-repudiable verdicts**.

We do not merely optimize machines. **We legalize the relationship between humans, machines, and decisions.**

> **The fundamental question SOPCOS answers:**  
> **“Who decided — and who is responsible?”**

---

## 🛡️ Core Philosophy — *Trust, Executed*

Traditional systems focus on **data**. SOPCOS focuses on the **verdict**.

* **Speed** requires reflex → **Synapse**
* **Trust** requires record → **Core Ledger**
* **Liability** requires signature → **Human Authority**

SOPCOS acts as a **digital notary** for autonomous systems. It does not judge decisions — it **proves** them.

---

## 🔌 The Four Pillars of Architecture

SOPCOS is not a single product. It is an ecosystem with **strict separation of powers**.

---

### 🔌 1. SYNAPSE — *Reflex & Hot Path*

The edge execution layer.

* Enforces deterministic safety policies (SIP-001)
* Applies **Pre-Law constraints** (physics, engineering limits)
* Acts within milliseconds (<10ms)
* **No AI, no discretion, no negotiation**

> Life safety always precedes optimization.

---

### 🧠 2. AXON — *Cognition & Cold Path* (Optional)

The analytical reasoning layer.

* Performs historical and predictive analysis
* Uses a **bicameral mind** model (thinking ≠ deciding)
* Generates early warnings and silent alerts
* Never executes physical actions directly

> Axon may advise.  
> Synapse decides.

---

### 🏛️ 3. CORE LEDGER — *The Immutable Record*

The memory and notary of the system.

* Seals verdicts, simulations, and liability transfers
* Stores **proof**, not opinions
* Immutable, auditable, regulator-grade

> The ledger does not control machines.  
> It silences disputes.

---

### 🆔 4. IDAS — *Industrial Digital Assets*

The identity layer for machines and models.

* Devices, software, and AI models are cryptographic assets
* Ownership, provenance, and service history are verifiable
* Prevents counterfeit hardware and rogue models

> Machines are no longer anonymous endpoints.  
> They are accountable entities.

## What SOPCOS Is Not

Clarity requires boundaries. SOPCOS is defined as much by what it **refuses to be** as by what it is.

* **SOPCOS is not a SCADA system.**  
  It does not visualize dashboards or operate actuators. It notarizes decisions.

* **SOPCOS is not an AI platform.**  
  Artificial intelligence may assist analysis, but it never holds authority or liability.

* **SOPCOS is not a cloud monitoring service.**  
  Data ownership remains with the operator, not the protocol.

* **SOPCOS is not a speculative blockchain.**  
  No tokens. No yield farming. No financial gamification.

* **SOPCOS is not open-core.**  
  Its constitution is open; its integrity is protected.

* **SOPCOS does not remove human control.**  
  It makes human intervention explicit, signed, and legally binding.

## 📜 The SOPCOS Constitution (SIPs)

SOPCOS is governed by a formal constitutional process defined through  
**Sopcos Improvement Proposals (SIPs)**.

SIPs define:

- Decision semantics  
- Authority hierarchy  
- Human intervention & liability  
- Reality binding & telemetry provenance  
- Governance and change control  

👉 **See the full constitution in [`/SIPs`](./SIPs/README.md)**  
👉 **Governance & authority model:** [`/governance/GOVERNANCE.md`](./governance/GOVERNANCE.md)

> Implementations may evolve.  
> **The Constitution does not.**

---

## ⚖️ Human Authority & Accountability

SOPCOS does not eliminate human responsibility — it **formalizes** it.

* **Override:**  
  A human may intervene, but must sign a cryptographic acceptance of liability.

* **Dirty State:**  
  After intervention, the system enters a tainted state that only an independent auditor can clear.

* **Proof of Foreknowledge:**  
  Simulation records eliminate the defense of *“I didn’t know the consequences.”*

> Power without signature is forbidden.

## 🚀 Project Status

* **Constitution:** Fixed & Ratified  
* **Governance Model:** Ratified  
* **Core Implementations:** In progress  
* **Release Strategy:** Deliberate, staged, and non-hyped  

SOPCOS is built as critical infrastructure — not a demo.

## 🤝 Governance & License

* **Protocol & Kernel:** AGPLv3 (Network Copyleft)
* **Standards & Documentation:** CC-BY-ND 4.0
* **Commercial Licensing:** Available via Sopcos Foundation

> These licenses are chosen to protect protocol integrity,
> not to restrict legitimate industrial use.
