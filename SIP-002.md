## 1. Abstract
This proposal defines the governance structure, participation roles, and licensing strategy for the Sopcos Ecosystem. It establishes a model of **"Controlled Freedom,"** designed to balance Open Source innovation with industrial-grade reliability and legal accountability. The goal is to prevent fragmentation and ensure that while the code remains free, the **"Legitimacy"** and **"Trust"** of the network remain secured by The Foundation.

## 2. Governance & Roles

### 2.1. The Foundation (Authority with Constraints)
The Foundation acts as the steward of the protocol, not a dictator.
* **Role:** Manages the SIP (Sopcos Improvement Proposal) process and holds trademark rights.
* **Procedural Constraint:** The Foundation cannot finalize a SIP or introduce "Breaking Changes" to the core SPL specification without the **technical consensus of at least 3 independent (not employed by the same legal entity) Core Maintainers**. This ensures decentralization of technical decisions and prevents corporate capture.

### 2.2. Vendors & Integrators (The Kernel Boundary)
Vendors are free to build gateways and proprietary GUIs/Wrappers around Sopcos. However, strict boundaries apply to the "Kernel."
* **Kernel Definition:** The "Kernel" includes the following immutable components:
    1.  **SPL Parser:** Logic for interpreting policy syntax.
    2.  **Decision Engine:** The deterministic evaluation logic.
    3.  **Audit Commit Logic:** The mechanism for hashing and committing decisions to Axon.
    4.  **Cryptographic Primitives:** Signature and verification libraries.
* **Compliance:** Any modification to these Kernel components results in the immediate loss of **"Sopcos Compliant"** status and invalidation of certification.

### 2.3. Operators (The Four-Eyes Principle)
Operators define logic but do not write code. To mitigate human error and insider threats:
* **Signature Requirement:** All SPL policies generated via GUI/DSL must be digitally signed by an authorized **Security Officer** or **Admin** before activation.
* **Enforcement:** Synapse nodes will reject any unsigned or unauthorized policy updates.

### 2.4. Operational Role Mapping (RBAC)
While the protocol identifies entities via DID/Public Keys, operational contexts (defined in SIP-005/006) require specific role attributes (e.g., "CISO", "HSE Officer").
* **Mapping:** The Foundation or the local Enterprise Admin MUST sign a **"Role Verifiable Credential"** linking a specific DID to a human-readable role.
* **Verification:** Synapse checks this credential before allowing actions restricted to specific roles (e.g., High-Risk Approvals).

## 3. Licensing Strategy: "Network Copyleft"

To protect the ecosystem from proprietary forks while encouraging enterprise adoption, a **Dual-Licensing Model** is adopted.

### 3.1. Primary License: AGPLv3 (Network Copyleft)
* **Scope:** The core codebase (Synapse/Axon) is licensed under AGPLv3.
* **Clarification:** Using Sopcos Synapse as a service (consuming its API via HTTP/MQTT) does **not** constitute a derivative work and does not force the consuming application (e.g., ERP, SCADA) to be open-sourced.
* **Viral Protection:** If a vendor modifies the *source code* of the Kernel and provides it as a service/product, they **must** release their modifications under AGPLv3. This prevents "Black Box" forks.

### 3.2. Commercial License (Enterprise Option)
* Vendors wishing to modify the Kernel and keep their changes proprietary must acquire a **Commercial License** from The Foundation. This ensures a sustainable revenue model.

## 4. Legitimacy & Trust Framework

### 4.1. Dynamic Certification (Revocable Trust)
Certification is treated as a living mechanism, not a static label.
* **Time-Bound:** "Certified Node Keys" are issued with an expiration date and must be renewed periodically.
* **Revocation (CRL):** The Foundation maintains a **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**. If a node or vendor is found to be malicious, non-compliant (e.g., modified Kernel), or compromised, their certificate is revoked immediately, marking them as "Untrusted" across the network.

### 4.2. Canonical Axon (Root of Legal Truth)
* **Definition:** "Canonical Axon" is the main chain recognized by The Foundation, starting from the specific Genesis Block defined in the protocol.
* **Legal Standing:** In the event of industrial disputes, audits, or insurance claims, only records found on the **Canonical Axon** are considered "Legal Truth." Records on forked or private chains have no standing in the Sopcos Dispute Resolution Framework.

## 5. Threat Mitigation (The Hostile Takeover Defense)
**Scenario:** Can a hostile entity fork the code and take over the ecosystem?
**Defense:**
1.  **Code:** They can fork the code (Open Source).
2.  **Brand:** They cannot use the "Sopcos" name (Trademark).
3.  **Trust:** They cannot issue valid certificates (Root of Trust).
4.  **Adoption:** Without valid certificates, their nodes are rejected by industry-standard systems.

**Conclusion:** The Foundation retains a **"Monopoly on Legitimacy,"** ensuring the ecosystem's integrity remains intact even if the code is copied.
